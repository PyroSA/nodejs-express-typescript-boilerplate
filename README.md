## Node.js, Express REST API development with TypeScript
##### Sample boilerplate project for node.js, express using TypeScript and Gulp.

### Why TypeScript?
I believe that TypeScript has been embraced as the choice language for building next generation web application using ECMAScript 6 (ES6) with strong typing. Strong typing doesnâ€™t necessarily improve the JavaScript that your Node.js server will execute, or the JavaScript that your browser might execute. However, it provides the developer more insight into public and 3rd party APIs as well as reducing the bugs (and development cycle to check for bugs) in the software we are developing.
